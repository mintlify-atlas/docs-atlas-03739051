title: Quickstart Guide
description: Deploy your first application on Zerops in under 5 minutes
---

This quickstart guide will walk you through deploying a complete Node.js application with PostgreSQL database on Zerops. You'll go from zero to a running application with just a few clicks—no complex configuration required.

## What You'll Deploy

You'll deploy a simple Node.js web application that:
- Connects to a PostgreSQL database
- Exposes a REST API endpoint
- Runs on a production-ready infrastructure with automatic scaling
- Gets a public subdomain for instant access

The entire stack will be configured, built, and deployed automatically.

## Prerequisites

All you need is:
- A web browser
- 5 minutes of your time

No credit card required for initial testing.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Zerops Account">
    Navigate to the [Zerops GUI](https://app.zerops.io) and sign up for a free account.

    You can register using:
    - Email and password
    - GitHub account
    - GitLab account
    - Google account

    After signing up, you'll land on your project dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import the Node.js Recipe Project">
    On your dashboard, locate the **Projects** section and click on **Import a project**.

    Copy and paste this YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
    project:
      name: recipe-nodejs
      tags:
        - zerops-quickstart

    services:
      - hostname: api
        type: nodejs@20
        enableSubdomainAccess: true
        buildFromGit: https://github.com/zeropsio/recipe-nodejs

      - hostname: db
        type: postgresql@16
        mode: NON_HA
        priority: 1
    ```

    Click **Import project** to start the deployment.

    ### What This Configuration Does

    Let's break down what's happening:

    **Project Configuration:**
    - Creates a new project named `recipe-nodejs`
    - Tags it for easy identification

    **API Service (Node.js):**
    - Creates a Node.js 20 runtime service named `api`
    - Enables public access via Zerops subdomain
    - Automatically builds from the GitHub repository
    - Configures load balancing, SSL, and autoscaling

    **Database Service (PostgreSQL):**
    - Creates a PostgreSQL 16 database named `db`
    - Runs in NON_HA mode (single container for development)
    - Priority 1 ensures the database starts before the API
    - Automatically configures secure internal networking

    <Note>
      The `buildFromGit` parameter triggers a one-time build and deployment from the specified repository. The repository contains a `zerops.yaml` file that tells Zerops how to build and run the application.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch the Deployment Process">
    After clicking import, Zerops will:

    1. **Create project infrastructure** (5-10 seconds)
       - Deploy L3 balancer with firewall
       - Set up L7 load balancer for HTTP traffic
       - Configure logging and statistics containers
       - Assign IPv6 and IPv4 addresses

    2. **Create the PostgreSQL database** (10-15 seconds)
       - Provision storage
       - Initialize database cluster
       - Set up automatic backups
       - Generate connection credentials

    3. **Build the Node.js application** (30-60 seconds)
       - Clone the GitHub repository
       - Create build container with Node.js 20
       - Run `npm install`
       - Execute build commands
       - Create application artifact

    4. **Deploy to runtime** (10-15 seconds)
       - Create runtime container(s)
       - Deploy built application
       - Run database migrations
       - Start the application
       - Configure routing and SSL

    You can watch the build progress in real-time by clicking on the running pipeline in your service detail.

    <Tip>
      The build log shows every command executed during the build process. This is incredibly useful for debugging if something goes wrong.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Your Deployed Application">
    Once all pipelines complete (indicated by green checkmarks), your application is live!

    ### Find Your Application URL

    1. Navigate to your project dashboard
    2. Click on the **api** service
    3. Look for the **IP Addresses & Public Routing Overview** section
    4. Find the subdomain URL (format: `https://api-<random-id>-8080.prg1.zerops.app`)

    ### Test the Application

    Click the subdomain URL to open your application in a browser. You should see:

    ```
    Hello, World!
    ```

    This simple response confirms your Node.js application is running and successfully connected to the PostgreSQL database.

    ### What Just Happened?

    Behind the scenes, your application:
    - Connected to the PostgreSQL database using environment variables automatically provided by Zerops
    - Ran database migrations during the initialization phase
    - Started serving HTTP requests through the load balancer
    - Got automatic SSL certificate for HTTPS access

    <Check>
      Your application is now running on production-ready infrastructure with automatic scaling, load balancing, and monitoring enabled!
    </Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore the Zerops Dashboard">
    Now that your application is running, explore the Zerops dashboard to see what's available:

    ### Service Overview
    - **Runtime Log**: Real-time logs from your application
    - **Build Log**: History of all builds and deployments
    - **Metrics**: CPU, RAM, and disk usage with automatic scaling visualization
    - **Containers**: View and manage individual containers

    ### Database Management
    - **Connection Info**: Access credentials and connection strings
    - **Backups**: Automatic backup configuration and manual backup triggers
    - **Metrics**: Database performance monitoring
    - **Logs**: PostgreSQL server logs

    ### Project Settings
    - **Environment Variables**: Manage secrets and configuration
    - **Public Access**: Configure domains and routing
    - **VPN**: Connect to your project's private network
    - **Team**: Invite collaborators

    <Info>
      All of this infrastructure—load balancers, firewalls, SSL certificates, logging, monitoring—is fully managed by Zerops. You just focus on your code.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding zerops.yaml

The magic behind the automated deployment is the `zerops.yaml` file in the recipe repository. Let's look at what it contains:

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: api
    build:
      base: nodejs@20
      buildCommands:
        - npm i
        - npm run build
      deployFiles: ./dist
      cache: node_modules
    run:
      base: nodejs@20
      start: npm start
```

### Configuration Breakdown

**`setup: api`** - Links this configuration to the `api` service

**Build Phase:**
- `base: nodejs@20` - Uses Node.js 20 build environment
- `buildCommands` - Commands to build your application
- `deployFiles: ./dist` - Only deploys the `dist` folder to runtime (smaller, faster)
- `cache: node_modules` - Caches dependencies for faster subsequent builds

**Run Phase:**
- `base: nodejs@20` - Uses Node.js 20 runtime environment
- `start: npm start` - Command to start your application

This simple configuration gives you:
- Automatic dependency installation
- Production builds
- Optimized artifact deployment
- Fast rebuilds with caching
- Zero-downtime deployments

    Create a `zerops.yaml` file in the root of your repository based on the example above. Customize the build and start commands for your application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Services in Zerops">
    Use the import YAML configuration to create your project structure, or create services manually through the GUI.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Your Repository">

title: Static Service
description: Simplified static hosting on Zerops with intelligent routing, CORS support, and built-in SEO optimization through an abstracted Nginx configuration.
---

The Static service provides a streamlined way to serve static content on Zerops. Built on Nginx but with a simplified configuration interface, it abstracts away complexity while maintaining the flexibility needed for modern web applications.

## Key Features

### Simplified Configuration
Instead of writing Nginx configuration directly, use YAML-based routing rules that are automatically translated into optimized Nginx configs. Focus on what your app needs, not how to configure a web server.

### Smart Default Routing
Out of the box, the Static service handles common patterns for modern web applications:
1. Try exact path (`/about` → `/about`)
2. Try with HTML extension (`/about` → `/about.html`)
3. Try directory index (`/docs` → `/docs/index.html`)
4. Fall back to SPA routing (`/app/route` → `/index.html`)
5. Return 404 if nothing matches

<Info>
  Single Page Applications work without any configuration. The automatic fallback to `/index.html` ensures client-side routing works correctly.
</Info>

### Advanced Routing Features
- **Masked redirects**: Show content from another URL while keeping the original URL
- **Wildcard patterns**: Handle multiple routes with a single rule
- **Domain management**: Redirect between multiple domains
- **Path preservation**: Keep paths when redirecting
- **Query preservation**: Maintain query parameters across redirects

### Built-in CORS Support
Enable CORS with a single configuration line. No need to understand Nginx's `add_header` directives.

### Custom Headers
Add security headers, cache control, or any custom headers with simple YAML configuration.

### SEO Optimization
Integrated [Prerender.io](https://prerender.io) support ensures search engines, social media crawlers, and AI tools can properly index your content.

## When to Use Static Service

### Perfect For:
- **Single Page Applications** (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte)
- **Static site generators** (Gatsby, Next.js static export, Nuxt static)
- **Documentation sites** (Docusaurus, VitePress, MkDocs)
- **Landing pages** and marketing sites
- **Simple static websites**

### Consider Full Nginx If:
- You need complete control over Nginx configuration
- You have complex server-side logic requirements
- You need custom Nginx modules
- You want to use advanced Nginx features not exposed by the Static service

<Tip>
  You can always switch from Static to full Nginx later. Zerops provides a migration tool that converts your Static configuration to a full Nginx config you can use as a starting point.
</Tip>

## Basic Configuration

Minimal `zerops.yaml` for a static service:

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    run:
      base: static
```

This simple configuration gives you:
- Optimized Nginx server
- SPA-friendly routing
- Alpine Linux base
- Automatic scaling

## Routing Configuration

### Simple Redirects

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    run:
      base: static
      routing:
        redirects:
          # Permanent redirect
          - from: /old-page
            to: /new-page
            status: 301
          
          # Masked redirect (shows /about content but keeps URL)
          - from: /about
            to: /about-us
```

### Domain Management

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    run:
      base: static
      routing:
        redirects:
          # Redirect entire domain
          - from: https://old-domain.com/*
            to: https://new-domain.com
            status: 301
            preserveQuery: true
          
          # Campaign-specific domain
          - from: https://promo.example.com/*
            to: https://example.com/campaign
            status: 302
```

### CORS Configuration

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    run:
      base: static
      routing:
        # Simple CORS (allows all origins)
        cors: "*"
        
        # Or with Nginx syntax
        cors: "'*' always"
```

### Custom Headers

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    run:
      base: static
      routing:
        headers:
          - for: "/"
            values:
              X-Frame-Options: "'DENY'"
              X-Content-Type-Options: "'nosniff' always"
              Content-Security-Policy: '"default-src ''self''" always'
```

<Warning>
  Header values are inserted directly into Nginx configuration. Always include proper quotes:
  - Simple values: `"'DENY'"`
  - Values with internal quotes: `'"default-src ''self''"`'
  - With 'always' directive: `"'value' always"`
</Warning>

## Framework Integration

The Static service works with any framework that generates static files:

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      base: nodejs@20
      buildCommands:
        - npm install
        - npm run build
      deployFiles:
        - dist/~  # Your framework's output directory
    run:
      base: static
```

**Popular frameworks:**
- **React**: Deploy `build/` or `dist/`
- **Vue**: Deploy `dist/`
- **Angular**: Deploy `dist/<project-name>/`
- **Svelte**: Deploy `build/` or `dist/`
- **Next.js**: Deploy `.next/` (static export)
- **Nuxt**: Deploy `.output/public/`
- **Gatsby**: Deploy `public/`

## SEO with Prerender

Enable Prerender.io to make your SPA SEO-friendly:

1. Set the `PRERENDER_TOKEN` secret variable in Zerops GUI
2. Optionally configure custom host:

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    run:
      base: static
      envVariables:
        PRERENDER_HOST: your.prerender.host
```

<Info>
  Prerender automatically detects crawlers (including AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude) and serves them pre-rendered HTML while users get the full interactive experience.
</Info>

## Migration to Full Nginx

If you need more control, you can migrate to a full Nginx service:

1. Go to your Static service in Zerops GUI
2. Click the three dots (⋮) in the left panel
3. Select **Need to switch to full Nginx service?**
4. Copy the generated Nginx configuration
5. Use it as a starting point for a full Nginx service

This preserves your routing logic and gives you complete control over Nginx configuration.

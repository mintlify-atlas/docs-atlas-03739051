title: Static Service Quickstart
description: Deploy your static site to Zerops in minutes with simplified configuration and intelligent routing.
---

This guide will help you deploy a static site to Zerops using the Static service. You'll learn how to set up the service, configure routing, and deploy your application.

## Prerequisites

- A Zerops account ([sign up](https://zerops.io) if you don't have one)
- A project in Zerops (create one in the GUI if needed)
- Static files to deploy (HTML, CSS, JS) or a framework that builds to static files

## Step 1: Create Static Service

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using GUI">
    1. Go to your project dashboard in Zerops
    2. Click **Add new service**
    3. Select **Static** as the service type
    4. Set a unique hostname (e.g., `app`, `web`, `site`)
    5. Configure scaling settings (optional)
    6. Click **Create service**
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Using zCLI">
    Create a `description.yaml` file:

    ```yaml description.yaml
    project:
      name: my-static-site
    services:
      - hostname: app
        type: static
        minContainers: 1
        maxContainers: 3
    ```

    Import the project:

    ```bash
    zcli project project-import description.yaml
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Configure Your Application

Create a `zerops.yaml` file in your repository root.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple Static Files">
    If you have pre-built static files:

    ```yaml zerops.yaml
    zerops:
      - setup: app
        run:
          base: static
    ```

    That's it! This minimal configuration:
    - Serves your static files
    - Handles SPA routing automatically
    - Uses sensible defaults

    <Info>
      Deploy your files using `zcli push` from your project directory.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="With Build Step">
    For frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular:

    ```yaml zerops.yaml
    zerops:
      - setup: app
        build:
          base: nodejs@20
          buildCommands:
            - npm install
            - npm run build
          deployFiles:
            - dist/~
          cache: node_modules
        run:
          base: static
    ```

    This configuration:
    - Uses Node.js to build your app
    - Deploys the `dist` folder content
    - Caches node_modules for faster builds
    - Serves with the Static service
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="With Custom Routing">
    Add custom redirects and CORS:

    ```yaml zerops.yaml
    zerops:
      - setup: app
        build:
          base: nodejs@20
          buildCommands:
            - npm install
            - npm run build
          deployFiles:
            - build/~
        run:
          base: static
          routing:
            # Enable CORS for API calls
            cors: "*"
            
            # Custom redirects
            redirects:
              # Permanent redirect
              - from: /old-page
                to: /new-page
                status: 301
              
              # Redirect old blog posts
              - from: /blog/*
                to: /articles/
                preservePath: true
                status: 301
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Deploy

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="From Git Repository">
    1. Go to your service in Zerops GUI
    2. Click **Connect to GitHub/GitLab**
    3. Authorize and select your repository
    4. Choose the branch
    5. Enable **Deploy on push** for automatic deployments
    6. Click **Deploy**

    <Tip>
      Every push to your selected branch will trigger an automatic deployment.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Using zCLI">
    From your project directory:

    ```bash
    # Login if needed
    zcli login

    # Push and deploy
    zcli push
    ```

    Watch the build and deployment logs in real-time.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Set Up Public Access

1. Navigate to your service in Zerops GUI
2. Go to **Public access & routing**
3. Click **Add new routing rule**
4. Choose:
   - **Zerops subdomain** (e.g., `myapp.zerops.app`), or
   - **Custom domain** (requires DNS configuration)
5. Save the routing rule

Your site is now live!

## Common Examples

          # Redirect www to non-www
          - from: https://www.example.com/*
            to: https://example.com
            status: 301
            preservePath: true
```

### Gatsby Site with SEO

      base: nodejs@20
      buildCommands:
        - npm install
        - npm run build
      deployFiles:
        - public/~
      cache:
        - node_modules
        - .cache
    run:
      base: static
      # Prerender.io token set as secret in Zerops GUI
```

### Multi-Domain Landing Pages

```yaml zerops.yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      base: nodejs@20
      buildCommands:
        - npm install
        - npm run build
      deployFiles:
        - dist/~
    run:
      base: static
      routing:
        redirects:
          # Product promo domain
          - from: https://promo.example.com/*
            to: https://example.com/special-offer
            status: 302
          
          # Legacy domain
          - from: https://old-site.com/*
            to: https://example.com
            status: 301
            preservePath: true
```

## Routing Patterns

### Masked Redirects

Show content from one URL while keeping another URL in the browser:

```yaml
routing:
  redirects:
    # URL stays /about, but shows content from /about-us
    - from: /about
      to: /about-us
```

<Info>
  No status code means it's a masked redirect. Perfect for URL aliases.
</Info>

### Path Preservation

Maintain the path when redirecting:

```yaml
routing:
  redirects:
    # /blog/post-1 → /articles/post-1
    - from: /blog/*
      to: /articles/
      preservePath: true
      status: 301
```

<Warning>
  When using `preservePath` with wildcards, ensure the `to` path ends with `/` for proper concatenation.
</Warning>

### Domain Redirects

```yaml
routing:
  redirects:
    # Redirect old domain to new
    - from: https://old-domain.com/*
      to: https://new-domain.com
      status: 301
      preserveQuery: true
    
    # Redirect all subdomains
    - from: https://*.staging.com/*
      to: https://production.com
      status: 302
```

## SEO Optimization

Enable Prerender.io for search engine visibility:

1. Sign up for [Prerender.io](https://prerender.io)
2. In Zerops GUI, add secret variable:
   - Name: `PRERENDER_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your Prerender.io token
3. (Optional) Set custom host in `zerops.yaml`:

```yaml
run:
  base: static
  envVariables:
    PRERENDER_HOST: custom.prerender.host
```

<Info>
  Prerender automatically detects crawlers from Google, Bing, social media platforms, and AI tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude).
</Info>

## Security Headers

Add security headers for production:

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    run:
      base: static
      routing:
        headers:
          - for: "/"
            values:
              X-Frame-Options: "'DENY'"
              X-Content-Type-Options: "'nosniff' always"
              X-XSS-Protection: "'1; mode=block' always"
              # CSP with escaped quotes
              Content-Security-Policy: '"default-src ''self''" always'
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="404 on page refresh (SPA routing)">
    The Static service handles this automatically. If you're getting 404s:
    - Check that you have an `index.html` in your root
    - Verify your `deployFiles` path is correct
    - Make sure you haven't overridden the default routing
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="CORS errors">
    Add CORS configuration:
    ```yaml
    routing:
      cors: "*"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Redirect not working">
    Check:
    - Status code is required for absolute URLs
    - Path preservation needs trailing `/` in target
    - Exact matches take priority over wildcards
    - Review logs in Zerops GUI for errors
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Build files not found">
    Verify your framework's output directory matches `deployFiles`:
    - React: `build/` (Create React App) or `dist/` (Vite)
    - Vue: `dist/`
    - Angular: `dist/<project-name>/`
    - Next.js: `.next/` (static export)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Custom headers not applied">
    Remember to quote header values:
    - Correct: `X-Frame-Options: "'DENY'"`
    - Wrong: `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Migration from Full Nginx

If you're migrating from a full Nginx service:

1. Review your current Nginx configuration
2. Map Nginx directives to Static service YAML:
   - `try_files` → Built-in default behavior
   - `rewrite` → `routing.redirects`
   - `add_header` for CORS → `routing.cors`
   - Other headers → `routing.headers`
3. Test thoroughly in a development environment
4. Deploy to production

<Tip>
  If you need features not available in Static service, you can always switch back to full Nginx using the migration tool in the GUI.

## Example Bun Application

Here's a simple Bun server with PostgreSQL:

```typescript title="server.ts"
import { serve } from "bun";
import { Pool } from "pg";

const pool = new Pool({
  host: "db",
  port: 5432,
  user: "db",
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  database: "db",
});

const server = serve({
  port: 3000,
  async fetch(req) {
    const result = await pool.query(
      "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM requests"
    );
    
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ 
        message: "Hello from Bun on Zerops!",
        count: result.rows[0].count 
      })
    );
  },
});

console.log(`Listening on http://localhost:${server.port}`);
```

With `zerops.yaml`:

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: api
    build:
      base: bun@1.1
      buildCommands:
        - bun install
        - bun build ./server.ts --outdir ./dist
      deployFiles:
        - dist
        - node_modules
        - package.json
      cache: node_modules
    
    run:
      base: bun@1.1
      ports:
        - port: 3000
      start: bun run dist/server.js
```

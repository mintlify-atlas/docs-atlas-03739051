---

The Nginx static service provides a robust, scalable web server optimized for serving static content on Zerops. Built on the industry-standard [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) web server, it offers both simplicity for basic deployments and powerful customization options for advanced use cases.

## Key Features

### High Performance Web Server
Nginx is renowned for its performance, stability, and low resource consumption. The Zerops implementation maintains these characteristics while adding enterprise-grade scalability.

### Flexible Deployment Options
You can use Nginx in two ways:
- **Runtime only**: Deploy pre-built static files directly (no build phase needed)
- **Build + Runtime**: Build your application using any framework (Node.js, PHP, Python, etc.), then serve it with Nginx

### Auto Scaling
Both vertical and horizontal auto scaling ensure your application runs smoothly while using only the necessary resources. Scale from 1 to 10 containers automatically based on demand.

### Built-in SEO Support
Integrated [Prerender.io](https://prerender.io) support ensures search engines and AI crawlers can properly index your Single Page Applications without additional configuration.

### Customizable Configuration
While Zerops provides sensible defaults, you have full control to customize:
- Nginx server configuration
- Document root directory
- Custom ports and protocols
- Environment variables
- Runtime environment packages

## Version Support

Zerops supports multiple Nginx versions:
- `nginx@latest` - Always uses the latest stable version
- `nginx@1.22` - Nginx 1.22.x
- `nginx@1.24` - Nginx 1.24.x
- `nginx@1.26` - Nginx 1.26.x

You can change the major version at any time through your `zerops.yaml` configuration.

## Base Environment

The base Nginx runtime environment includes:
- Alpine Linux (default) or Ubuntu
- Selected Nginx version
- Zerops CLI tools
- Common utilities: `composer`, `git`, `wget`

## Default Configuration

Out of the box, Nginx is configured to:
- Listen on port 80 (HTTP)
- Serve content from `/var/www`
- Fall back to `index.html` for Single Page Applications
- Log to system logger for centralized log management

```nginx
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;

    server_name _;
    root /var/www;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    access_log syslog:server=unix:/dev/log,facility=local1,tag=nginx,severity=info default_short;
    error_log syslog:server=unix:/dev/log,facility=local1,tag=nginx,severity=error;
}
```

## Common Use Cases

### Single Page Applications
Perfect for serving React, Vue, Angular, or any other SPA framework. The default configuration automatically handles client-side routing.

### Static Websites
Ideal for serving static HTML/CSS/JS sites, documentation, landing pages, or any pre-built content.

### Frontend Applications
Deploy the built output from modern frontend frameworks like Next.js (static export), Nuxt (static), Gatsby, or similar.

## Network & Access

All services within a Zerops project share a dedicated private network. Access your Nginx service from other services using its hostname and internal port (e.g., `app:80`).

For public access, configure routing and domains through the Zerops GUI. All HTTPS traffic is automatically terminated at the Zerops load balancer with SSL certificates managed for you.

<Info>
  Do not configure port 443 in your Nginx service. HTTPS is handled by Zerops infrastructure, and requests are forwarded to your service as HTTP on port 80.

description: Get started with Nginx on Zerops in minutes. Learn how to create a service and deploy your static content.
---

This guide will help you deploy static content with Nginx on Zerops. You'll create a service, configure it, and deploy your application.

## Prerequisites

- A Zerops account ([sign up](https://zerops.io) if you don't have one)
- A project in Zerops (create one in the GUI if needed)

## Step 1: Create Nginx Service

You can create an Nginx service using either the Zerops GUI or zCLI.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using GUI">
    1. Navigate to your project dashboard
    2. Click **Add new service** in the Services menu
    3. Select **Nginx** as the service type
    4. Choose your Nginx version (or use `latest`)
    5. Set a unique hostname (e.g., `app`, `web`, `frontend`)
    6. Optionally configure:
       - Secret environment variables
       - Auto scaling settings
    7. Click **Create service**

    <Info>
      The hostname must be unique within your project, contain only lowercase letters (a-z) or numbers (0-9), and be maximum 25 characters.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Using zCLI">
    First, [install and set up zCLI](/references/cli) if you haven't already.

    Create a `description.yaml` file:

    ```yaml description.yaml
    project:
      name: my-project
    services:
      - hostname: app
        type: nginx@latest
        minContainers: 1
        maxContainers: 6
    ```

    Then import the project:

    ```bash
    zcli project project-import description.yaml
    ```

    <Accordion title="Add to Existing Project">
      If you already have a project, create an `import.yaml` file with just the services section:

      ```yaml import.yaml
      services:
        - hostname: app
          type: nginx@latest
          minContainers: 1
          maxContainers: 6
      ```

      Then run:

      ```bash
      zcli project service-import import.yaml
      ```
    </Accordion>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Configure Your Application

Create a `zerops.yaml` file in the root of your repository to configure how Zerops builds and runs your application.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pre-built Files">
    If you already have built static files and just want to deploy them:

    ```yaml zerops.yaml
    zerops:
      - setup: app
        run:
          base: nginx@latest
          documentRoot: public
    ```

    This minimal configuration:
    - Uses the latest Nginx version
    - Serves files from the `/var/www/public` directory
    - Uses default settings for everything else
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Build + Deploy">
    If you need to build your application (e.g., using Node.js, npm, etc.):

    ```yaml zerops.yaml
    zerops:
      - setup: app
        build:
          base: nodejs@20
          buildCommands:
            - npm install
            - npm run build
          deployFiles:
            - dist/~
          cache: node_modules
        run:
          base: nginx@latest
          documentRoot: dist
    ```

    This configuration:
    - Uses Node.js 20 for building
    - Installs dependencies and runs build
    - Deploys everything from the `dist` folder
    - Caches `node_modules` for faster builds
    - Serves the built files from `/var/www/dist`
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Advanced">
    For more complex scenarios with custom commands and environment variables:

    ```yaml zerops.yaml
    zerops:
      - setup: app
        build:
          base: nodejs@20
          prepareCommands:
            - npm install -g pnpm
          buildCommands:
            - pnpm install
            - pnpm run build
          deployFiles:
            - dist/~
          cache:
            - node_modules
            - .pnpm-store
        run:
          base: nginx@latest
          documentRoot: dist
          initCommands:
            - rm -rf ./cache
          envVariables:
            APP_ENV: production
            API_URL: https://api.example.com
    ```

    This advanced setup:
    - Installs pnpm as a custom package manager
    - Caches both node_modules and pnpm store
    - Clears cache on each container start
    - Sets environment variables for runtime
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Deploy Your Application

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="From Git">
    The recommended approach is to connect your Git repository:

    1. Go to your service detail in Zerops GUI
    2. Click **Connect to GitHub/GitLab**
    3. Authorize Zerops and select your repository
    4. Choose the branch to deploy from
    5. Zerops will automatically detect your `zerops.yaml`
    6. Click **Deploy**

    <Tip>
      Set up automatic deployments by enabling **Deploy on push**. Every commit to your selected branch will trigger a new deployment.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Using zCLI">
    Deploy directly from your local machine using zCLI:

    ```bash
    # Login to Zerops
    zcli login

    # Deploy your application
    zcli push
    ```

    The `zcli push` command will:
    - Package your application
    - Upload it to Zerops
    - Trigger the build and deploy pipeline
    - Show real-time logs

    <Info>
      Make sure you're in the directory containing your `zerops.yaml` file when running `zcli push`.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Configure Public Access

By default, your service is only accessible within the Zerops private network. To make it publicly accessible:

1. Go to your service detail in Zerops GUI
2. Navigate to **Public access & routing** in the left menu
3. Click **Add new routing rule**
4. Configure your domain:
   - Use a Zerops subdomain (e.g., `app.zerops.app`)
   - Or add your custom domain
5. Save the routing rule

<Info>
  For custom domains, you'll need to add DNS records pointing to Zerops. The GUI will show you exactly what records to create.
</Info>

## Example: Deploy a React App

Here's a complete example for deploying a React application:

```yaml zerops.yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      base: nodejs@20
      buildCommands:
        - npm ci
        - npm run build
      deployFiles:
        - build/~
      cache: node_modules
    run:
      base: nginx@latest
      documentRoot: build
```

**Project structure:**
```
my-react-app/
├── public/
├── src/
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── zerops.yaml
```

**Deployment steps:**
1. Add `zerops.yaml` to your React project root
2. Commit and push to your Git repository
3. Connect the repository in Zerops GUI
4. Watch the build and deploy process
5. Access your app via the provided URL

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My app shows a blank page">
    Check that your `documentRoot` in `zerops.yaml` matches where your build output is located. For example, if your build creates a `dist` folder, use `documentRoot: dist`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Client-side routing doesn't work (404 errors)">
    The default Nginx configuration handles this automatically with `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html`. If you've customized your Nginx config, make sure you have this directive.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Build fails with 'command not found'">
    Make sure you're using the correct base image for your build. For example, if you're using npm commands, you need `base: nodejs@<version>` in your build section.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I see build logs?">
    Go to your service detail in Zerops GUI, click on **Service dashboard & runtime containers**, then **Open pipeline detail** to see complete build and deploy logs.
  </Accordion>

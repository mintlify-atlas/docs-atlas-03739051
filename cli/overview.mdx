## Common Use Cases

### Deploy Applications

Deploy your application code to Zerops:

```bash
zcli push
```

This command builds and deploys your application based on the configuration in your `zerops.yml` file.

### Access Services via VPN

Connect to your services securely using the Zerops VPN:

```bash
zcli vpn up
```

Once connected, you can access your databases, caches, and other services directly from your local machine.

### View Logs

Stream real-time logs from your services:

```bash
zcli service log --follow
```

### Manage Projects

Create and manage projects from the command line:

```bash
# Create a new project
zcli project create --name "My Project"

# List all projects
zcli project list

# Import services from YAML
zcli project service-import ./services.yml
```

## Configuration

zCLI supports multiple configuration methods:

1. **Configuration files** - `.zcli.yaml` in your project or home directory
2. **Environment variables** - Prefix any flag with `ZEROPS_`
3. **Command-line flags** - Pass options directly to commands

See the [Configuration guide](/cli/configuration) for detailed information.

## Getting Help

Every command supports the `--help` flag:

```bash
zcli --help
zcli push --help
zcli vpn up --help
```

You can also use the built-in support command:

```bash
zcli support
```

## What is Zerops?

Zerops is a **developer-first Platform-as-a-Service** built entirely from scratch on bare metal infrastructure. It delivers the perfect balance of **developer experience**, **flexibility**, **scalability**, and **affordability**—making it an ideal choice for applications of any size, complexity, and traffic level.

Unlike traditional cloud platforms that force you to choose between ease-of-use and power, Zerops gives you both. Deploy production-ready applications in minutes while maintaining full control over your infrastructure configuration.

## Core Features

### Dedicated Infrastructure Per Project

Zerops deploys custom dedicated infrastructure for each project, including:

- **L3 balancer** with firewall and unique IP addresses
- **Logger and Statistics** containers for comprehensive monitoring
- **L7 load balancer** handling HTTP traffic, SSL termination, and certificate management
- **Private network** created with VXLAN for secure service communication

Services within your project communicate securely using internal hostnames and can reference each other's environment variables—no complex networking setup required.

### Flexible Build & Deploy Pipeline

Zerops uses full Linux OS containers (via Incus) providing the perfect middle ground between Docker containers and full VMs. You get:

- Pre-prepared build and runtime images for popular technologies
- Powerful, flexible pipeline to customize both build and runtime environments
- Automatic builds via GitHub/GitLab integration or manual triggers via CLI
- No Docker registries needed—built-in artifact management
- Zero-downtime deployments with automatic rollback capabilities

### Intelligent Autoscaling

Zerops provides fully automatic horizontal and vertical scaling:

- **Vertical scaling**: Resources adjust from 0.25 GB RAM / 1 CPU core to 32 GB RAM / 10 CPU cores per container
- **Horizontal scaling**: Add or remove containers automatically based on load (1-10 containers)
- **Database HA modes**: Choose between single-container or highly-available multi-container setups
- **Smart optimization**: Performance tuning happens automatically as services scale

You'll never overprovision or underprovision resources again. Your services always have exactly what they need.

title: API Overview
description: Get started with the Zerops REST API to programmatically manage your projects, services, and infrastructure
---

The Zerops REST API allows you to programmatically interact with the Zerops platform by providing access to resources like projects, services, users, billing, and configurations.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.app-prg1.zerops.io/api/rest/public
```

## Getting Started

To get started with the Zerops API:

1. **Obtain a Personal Access Token** from the [Access Token management](https://app.zerops.io/settings/token-management) section in the Zerops GUI
2. **Include the token** in your API requests using Bearer authentication
3. **Explore the available endpoints** using our [Swagger documentation](https://api.app-prg1.zerops.io/api/rest/public/swagger)

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and platform stability. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses will include the requested data, while error responses will contain an error message and appropriate HTTP status code.

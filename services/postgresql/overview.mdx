title: PostgreSQL Service Overview
description: Powerful, reliable PostgreSQL database service with automatic scaling and high availability in Zerops.
---

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

## Key Features

### Automatic Scaling
Zerops automatically scales your PostgreSQL service based on actual database usage:
- **Vertical auto-scaling** for CPU, RAM, and disk resources
- Configure minimum and maximum resource limits
- Choose between shared or dedicated CPU modes
- Set custom scaling thresholds

Learn more in [How Zerops scales PostgreSQL](/postgresql/how-to/scale).

### High Availability Mode
Run PostgreSQL in highly available mode for production environments:
- **3 database containers** with automatic failover
- **2 free database proxies** for connection management
- Containers distributed across different physical machines
- **Redundant data storage** in 3 identical copies
- Automatic recovery from container or machine failures
- **Dedicated read replica port** (5433) for improved performance

### Single Container Mode
For development and non-critical environments:
- One container with vertical scaling
- Cost-effective for testing and development
- Full PostgreSQL functionality

### Automated Backups
- Encrypted backups using `pg_dump`
- Configurable retention policies
- Manual and scheduled backups
- Protected tags for important snapshots
- Stored in isolated object storage

See [Backup in PostgreSQL](/postgresql/how-to/backup) for details.

### Built-in Management
- Default database and user created automatically
- Environment variables for easy connection
- Support for PostgreSQL plugins and extensions
- Web-based management tools (AdminerEvo, phpMyAdmin)
- Command-line access via VPN

## Supported Versions

Zerops supports multiple PostgreSQL versions. Choose the version that best fits your application requirements when creating the service.

## Connection Options

### Internal Connections
Connect from services within the same Zerops project:
- Private network with no SSL/TLS required
- Use service hostname and port 5432
- Environment variables available
- Read replicas on port 5433 (HA mode only)

### Remote Connections
Connect from outside Zerops:
- **VPN access** - Secure connection via Zerops VPN
- **Direct IP access** - TLS-encrypted connections via pgBouncer
- IPv6 available by default, IPv4 with add-on

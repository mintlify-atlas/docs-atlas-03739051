title: KeyDB
description: Fast, multithreaded Redis-compatible database with enhanced performance capabilities.
---

[KeyDB](https://docs.keydb.dev/) is a fully open source database, a faster drop-in alternative to Redis. It offers enhanced performance, multithreading capabilities, and maintains full compatibility with Redis clients and APIs.

<Warning>
While KeyDB is available in Zerops, please note that KeyDB development has not been very active recently. For new Redis-compatible deployments, we recommend considering [Valkey](/services/valkey/overview) as the preferred alternative due to its active development and ongoing support.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

### Creating a KeyDB Service

You can create a KeyDB service using:

1. **Zerops GUI** - Through the web interface when adding a new service to your project
2. **zCLI** - Using the command-line interface
3. **Import** - Via a YAML configuration file

### Example Configuration

```yaml
services:
  - hostname: keydb
    type: keydb@6
    mode: NON_HA
```

For HA (High Availability) deployments:

```yaml
services:
  - hostname: keydb
    type: keydb@6
    mode: HA
```

## Connection Methods

### Connect from Same Project

Services within the same Zerops project can connect to KeyDB using internal DNS:

```bash
redis://keydb:6379
```

### Connect Remotely

For remote connections, use [Zerops VPN](/references/networking/vpn) to securely access your KeyDB instance.

## Managing Your Database

KeyDB provides a Redis-compatible interface for all database operations. You can:

- Use any Redis client library
- Execute Redis commands directly
- Manage keys and data structures
- Monitor performance metrics

### Using Redis CLI

Connect via VPN and use the Redis CLI:

```bash
redis-cli -h keydb -p 6379
```

## Use Cases

KeyDB is suitable for:

- **High-performance caching** - Leverage multithreading for improved throughput
- **Session storage** - Fast read/write access for user sessions
- **Real-time analytics** - Track metrics and counters
- **Message queues** - Pub/sub patterns for event distribution
- **Rate limiting** - API request throttling

## Popular Guides

- [zCLI](/references/cli) - Get even more out of Zerops with the command-line tool
- [Zerops VPN](/references/networking/vpn) - Connect to your KeyDB service securely
- [Environment Variables](/features/env-variables) - Configure your application connections

## Migration to Valkey

If you're considering migrating from KeyDB to Valkey:

1. Both are Redis-compatible, so client code requires minimal changes
2. Export your data using Redis dump/restore commands
3. Create a new Valkey service in Zerops
4. Import your data to the new service
5. Update your application connection strings

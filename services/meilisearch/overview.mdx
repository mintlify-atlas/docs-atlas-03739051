---

Deploy and manage Meilisearch on a fully managed infrastructure. Get instant access to fast, typo-tolerant search with zero operational overhead.

## Supported Versions

Zerops currently supports Meilisearch versions **1.10** and **1.11**.

When importing a service, use version format:
- `meilisearch@1.10`
- `meilisearch@1.11`

## Service Configuration

Our Meilisearch implementation runs as a **single-node** setup, as Meilisearch does not currently support cluster configurations.

### Environment Modes

<Note>
Environment mode affects the availability of certain features and can impact your application's security. Choose carefully based on your use case.
</Note>

#### Production Mode (Default)

- Optimized for performance and security
- Search Preview (Mini-dashboard) disabled
- Recommended for production deployments

#### Development Mode

- Includes Search Preview (Mini-dashboard)
- Enhanced debugging capabilities
- Suitable for development and testing

#### Switching Between Modes

To switch between modes:

1. Navigate to the **Environment variables** section in the Meilisearch service detail
2. Scroll to the **Generated Variables**
3. Set the `environment` variable to either:
   - `production` - for production mode (default)
   - `development` - for development mode with Mini-dashboard
4. Restart the service to apply changes

### API Key Management

The service provides three pre-configured API keys, each with specific access levels:

#### `masterKey`

- Root access to your Meilisearch instance
- Use only for initial setup and key management
- **Never expose in application code or frontend**

#### `defaultSearchKey`

- Read-only search operations across all indices
- Safe for frontend implementations
- **Can be exposed in client-side code**

#### `defaultAdminKey`

- Full administrative access to all indices
- For backend operations and index management
- **Keep secure in backend services only**

[Custom API keys](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/reference/api/keys) provide fine-grained access control for specific use cases. For example, you might create:

- Search-only keys for specific indices
- Temporary keys with expiration dates
- Keys with restricted actions for third-party integrations

## Network Architecture & Access

### Public HTTPS Access

When enabled, access via [Zerops subdomain](/references/networking/public-access#zerops-subdomain-access).

### Internal Project Access

Services within the same project can reach Meilisearch directly:

```
http://{hostname}:7700
```

## Backup and Restore

### Backup Format

Meilisearch backups are created using native dump commands:

- **Format**: `.dump` (standard Meilisearch dump)
- **Tooling**: Native dump command
- **Content**: Contains index data and settings

For backup configuration, scheduling, retention policies, and management options, see the [Zerops Backups](/features/backup) documentation.

### Restoring Backups

To restore a Meilisearch backup:

1. **Download** the backup file (`.dump`) from the Zerops UI
2. **Prepare** your target environment (clean existing indices or use a new instance)
3. **Restore** using the Meilisearch API. Use the dump import endpoint to restore your data. Follow the [official Meilisearch documentation](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/data_backup/dumps#importing-a-dump-in-self-hosted-instances) for detailed restore procedures.

For assistance with the restoration process, contact Zerops support.

## Quick Start Example

Here's a minimal example of implementing search in a React application:

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

const MEILISEARCH_URL = process.env.zeropsSubdomain;
const SEARCH_KEY = process.env.defaultSearchKey;

function SearchComponent() {
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);

  const handleSearch = async (query) => {
    const response = await fetch(`${MEILISEARCH_URL}/indexes/products/search`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${SEARCH_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        q: query,
        limit: 10
      })
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    setResults(data.hits);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="search"
        onChange={(e) => handleSearch(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Search products..."
      />
      <ul>
        {results.map(hit => (
          <li key={hit.id}>{hit.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Use Cases

Meilisearch is ideal for:

- **E-commerce Search** - Product catalogs with instant results
- **Documentation Sites** - Fast, relevant content discovery
- **SaaS Applications** - Multi-tenant search capabilities
- **Content Platforms** - Articles, blog posts, and media search
- **Mobile Apps** - Lightweight search with offline support

## Best Practices

### Security

- Store sensitive keys (`masterKey`, `defaultAdminKey`) securely in backend services
- Use `defaultSearchKey` or custom keys with minimal permissions for frontend
- Rotate custom keys periodically

### Performance

- Implement debouncing for search inputs
- Cache frequently accessed search results
- Monitor response times and adjust index settings
- Use appropriate batch sizes for bulk operations

### Error Handling

- Implement retry logic for temporary failures
- Set appropriate timeout values for your use case
- Handle rate limiting gracefully

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Problems

- Check if your instance is in the correct environment mode
- Ensure your API keys have the necessary permissions
- Confirm your service is running and healthy in the Zerops dashboard

### Search Performance

- Review your index settings for optimal search performance
- Monitor your instance's resource usage
- Consider implementing client-side caching for frequent searches

### API Key Issues

- Verify you're using the correct key type for your operation (search vs. admin)
- Check key permissions match your intended operations
- Ensure keys are properly formatted in your Authorization header
- Remember that master and admin keys should never be used in frontend code

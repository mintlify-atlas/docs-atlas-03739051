title: MariaDB Service Overview
description: Reliable, open source MariaDB database service with automatic scaling and high availability in Zerops.
---

[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) is one of the most popular open source relational databases. It's made by the original developers of MySQL and guaranteed to stay open source.

## Key Features

### Automatic Scaling
Zerops automatically scales your MariaDB service based on actual database usage:
- **Vertical auto-scaling** for CPU, RAM, and disk resources
- Configure minimum and maximum resource limits
- Choose between shared or dedicated CPU modes
- Set custom scaling thresholds

Learn more in [How Zerops scales MariaDB](/mariadb/how-to/scale).

### High Availability Mode
Run MariaDB in highly available mode for production environments:
- **3 database containers** with automatic failover
- **2 free database proxies** for connection management
- Containers distributed across different physical machines
- **Redundant data storage** in 3 identical copies
- Automatic recovery from container or machine failures

### Single Container Mode
For development and non-critical environments:
- One container with vertical scaling
- Cost-effective for testing and development
- Full MariaDB functionality

### Automated Backups
- Encrypted backups using `mariabackup`
- Configurable retention policies
- Manual and scheduled backups
- Protected tags for important snapshots
- Stored in isolated object storage

See [Backup & Restore MariaDB](/mariadb/how-to/backup) for details.

### Built-in Management
- Default database and user created automatically
- Environment variables for easy connection
- Web-based management tools (Adminer, phpMyAdmin)
- Command-line access via VPN

### MySQL Compatibility
MariaDB is designed to be compatible with MySQL, but you can configure system variables like `lower_case_table_names` for specific compatibility requirements during service creation.

## Supported Versions

Zerops supports multiple MariaDB versions. Choose the version that best fits your application requirements when creating the service.

## Connection Options

### Internal Connections
Connect from services within the same Zerops project:
- Private network with no SSL/TLS required
- Use service hostname and port 3306
- Environment variables available
- Secure by default via project's private network

### Remote Connections
Connect from outside Zerops:
- **VPN access** - Secure connection via Zerops VPN
- Direct access is not available for security reasons

<Warning>
Due to security reasons, Zerops doesn't allow exposing MariaDB service directly to the internet. Use VPN for remote connections.
</Warning>

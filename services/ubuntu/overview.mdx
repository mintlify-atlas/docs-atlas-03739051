description: Flexible Ubuntu container environments for running custom applications and unsupported technologies in Zerops.
---

[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) is a popular Linux distribution based on Debian, widely used for servers, cloud computing, and containerized applications.

Ubuntu services in Zerops provide a flexible base environment for running applications built with technologies that aren't officially supported by Zerops, or for custom setups requiring full control over the runtime environment.

## Getting Started

Ubuntu services give you a blank canvas to build upon. You can:

- Install any software packages you need
- Configure custom runtime environments
- Run applications in languages not natively supported by Zerops
- Create specialized development or testing environments

### Creating an Ubuntu Service

You can create an Ubuntu service using:

1. **Zerops GUI** - Through the web interface when adding a new service
2. **zCLI** - Using the command-line interface

### Configuration Example

```yaml
services:
  - hostname: app
    type: ubuntu@24
```

## Build and Runtime Configuration

### Customize Build Environment

Use the build phase to install dependencies and prepare your application:

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      base: ubuntu@24
      buildCommands:
        - apt-get update
        - apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
        - pip3 install -r requirements.txt
      deployFiles:
        - app/
        - requirements.txt
```

### Customize Runtime Environment

Configure how your application runs:

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    run:
      base: ubuntu@24
      prepareCommands:
        - apt-get update
        - apt-get install -y python3
      start: python3 app/main.py
      ports:
        - port: 8080
          httpSupport: true
```

## Scaling Configuration

Ubuntu services support both horizontal and vertical scaling:

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    # ... other config
    verticalAutoscaling:
      minCpu: 1
      maxCpu: 5
      minRam: 0.5
      maxRam: 4
    horizontalAutoscaling:
      minContainers: 1
      maxContainers: 3
```

This ensures your service runs smoothly while using only necessary resources.

## Use Cases

Ubuntu services are ideal for:

- **Custom Technology Stacks** - Languages or frameworks not officially supported by Zerops
- **Legacy Applications** - Running older applications with specific dependency requirements
- **Testing Environments** - Creating isolated environments for testing
- **Specialized Tools** - Running domain-specific software or tools
- **Research & Development** - Experimental projects requiring custom configurations

## Common Patterns

### Installing System Dependencies

```yaml
build:
  buildCommands:
    - apt-get update
    - apt-get install -y build-essential curl git
```

### Managing Application Dependencies

```yaml
build:
  buildCommands:
    - pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    # or
    - bundle install
    # or
    - composer install
```

### Multi-Stage Builds

```yaml
build:
  buildCommands:
    # Install build dependencies
    - apt-get update
    - apt-get install -y build-essential
    # Build application
    - make build
  deployFiles:
    # Only deploy built artifacts
    - dist/
```

## Best Practices

### Performance

- Install only necessary packages to reduce image size
- Use package manager caching where possible
- Optimize startup commands for faster container initialization

### Security

- Keep system packages updated
- Remove unnecessary packages after build
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Follow principle of least privilege

### Maintainability

- Document custom installation steps
- Use version pinning for dependencies
- Keep build and runtime configurations separate
- Test configuration changes in development first
